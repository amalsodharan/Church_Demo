            <h3>We welcome everyone to the Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite) parish in Canada's National Capital Region of Ottawa. The Holy Service (Qurbono) is typically conducted bilingually with a mix of both Malayalam and Syriac languages used for the hymns and prayers. Malayalam is the mother tongue for many of our members hailing from Kerala, India and Syriac is an ancient language that has been used in Christian liturgy for centuries, thereby helping to connect us to the early Christian communities in the Middle East.</h3>
